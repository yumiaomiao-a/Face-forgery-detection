# Face-forgery-detection
This code concerns the construction of a novel forgery discriminator with better comprehensive capabilities. Through analysis of the visual characteristics of manipulated images from the perspective of image quality, it is revealed that the synthesized face does have different degrees of quality degradation compared to the source content. Therefore, several kinds of image-quality related handicraft features were extracted to unveil the inconsistent information and modification traces in the fake faces. In this way, a 1065-dimensional vector of each image was obtained through multi-feature fusion, and it was then fed into RF to train a targeted binary classification detector.
